# LegendTestDirectory

A sample project based of Angular's Tour of Heroes application with minor modification. Used for future reference and refreshing memory.

Things of note:

* Basics of routing and navigation
* Workings between HTML and TS (Such as data binding)
* When to handle in UI TS vs in Services
* Angular's built in helpers (i.e ng generate component/service/module)
* <b>Mocking a remote server using in-memory-web-api</b>
* CRUD methods
* HTTP requests and nifty tricks to handle it

Things not explored (yet):

* Unit and E2E Testing
* Styling (frankly speaking, the app looks like utter shite)

Best case scenario, maybe turn this into a boilerplate.

Worse case scenario, this can serve as a good refresher.

Either ways
